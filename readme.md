#### SAML
    - Security Assertion Markup Language
      - Used for SSO
        - Single Sign On
          - Centralized Point of Authentication
            - This allows users to authenticate to one centralized point
      - Identity Provider (IDP)
      - Service Provider (SP)
      - SAML Request
      - SAML Response
      - Assertion
      - XML Signatures (DSig)
      - Assertion Consumer Service
        - Responsible for receiving the response from the service provider, checking the signatures and validating the entire document
        - In the SAML response
          - first name, last name, user informatio identity, called attributes
          - relay state is a way for the identity provider to remember where a user was before authentication
            - This is so the user does not have to re-navigate to the spot
        - SAML trust
          - configuration between the identity provider and the service provider
          - Information Shared:
          -- signing ticket
          -- idenity ID (issuer)
        - Metadata
          - Share XML configuration file, or share URLs to XML configuration files
      - Multiple places the user can start the authentication process
      - IDP init - Going to IDP and starting the process
        - Needs to understand how to receive a SAML request and issue a SAML response
      - SP init - there is a SAML request, and a SAML response
        - SP needs to be able to receive a SAML response, potentially how to generate a SAML request
  
      - All XML both request and response
        <samlp:***>
        - id - generated by service provider
        - issueinstant - timestamp for the request
          - can only accept within a certain timeframe
        - destination - can check that this is the intended destination
        - AssertationConsumerURL - IDP can check that the place we are telling it to send the user is the same place
        - issuer - predefined string that is a URL formatted string, issuer must match what the IDP expects
      - This XML is stringified, encoded and passed in the query string when it redirects the user, then the authentication happens and the response is prepared
